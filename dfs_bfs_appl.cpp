----DFS APPLICATIONS

1. Minimum Spanning Tree - A tree with no cycles but covers every node #edges = v-1 
<> Firstly it must be a spanning tree and secondly sum of all the edges should be minimum
2. Cycle Detection - using visited idea
3. If a path exists between 2 nodes
4. ** Topological Sorting - (Only for Directed Acyclic Graph) dependency check a->b->c->..... ordering vertices such that there are no dependencies
5. Bipartite Check (2-coloring): Dividing graph into two parts 
6. Strongly Connected Components (SCC) : Kosaraju Algorithm
7. Maze Problems. - 2D Grid

---------------------------------------------

----BFS APPLICATONS
1. Shortest Path in an undirected graph (here distance is same as # edges)
2. Cycle Detection
3. Bipartite Check
4. Path between 2 nodes
5. Minimum Spanning Tree in unweighted graph
6. Social networking websites : Linkedin - profile of a person connected or not,
     if not directly connected to you then "1st" it means connection of connection
     A connection of connection of connection would show "2nd" and so on.
7. GPS   
8. Network Broadcasting
9. Finding Connected Components in a Graph
